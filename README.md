### The Maps

- [Crawlables](https://crepuscularcremini.github.io/HopSkipJump/Crawlables/crawl.html) - For the crawlers, meant for on-the-fly brewery crawls, see the walk, bike, and transit times to all the breweries in the area (or filter by time). Geolocating (upper left) shows the closest brewery to the user. Other regions are available from the drop down in the lower right.
- Trekkables - For the explorers, all of the breweries reachable by rapid transit or bike trails (or both if you don't want to have to bike back), great for a weekend trip to a new area. Split into generalized (all trails, all trains) and curated (specific trails and / or trains).

### The Purpose
The “craft beer revolution” has lead to an explosion in the number of small local breweries across the US and Canada. These breweries are increasingly becoming important neighbourhood third-places where people can gather, and breweries tie themselves directly to the neighbourhood and community in which they operate. Critically, third spaces need to be open and inviting[^1], however this is not always the case for breweries. As Chapman and Brunsma[^2] note, the “exposure to craft beer is crucial in the development of a taste for craft beer. As we have seen, the craft industry seems to have made little effort to be inclusive of minority drinkers.” The craft beer industry is generally dominated by white males (on both production and consumption sides) and the culture that comes with that dominance makes it difficult to be open and inviting to all.

While other changes are necessary in the industry and the community (and here I turn to Chapman and Brunsma for their extensive work on this topic, particularly in Beer and Racism noted below), in order to make breweries open and inviting to all, an important step is purely exposure: knowing where breweries are, if they are in the neighbourhood, and how to get to them if they are not. This project seeks to use creative mapping as a tool to connect people to their neighbourhood breweries and increase exposure to craft beer both as a drink and a community. Furthermore, it seeks to use breweries as a method through which to encourage exploration of Ontario (and elsewhere) outside of the ‘neighbourhood’ using sustainable modes of transportation.
